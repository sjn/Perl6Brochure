# Perl6Brochure
The home of my Perl 6 brochure.

I've been working on that for 3 years, and handed out a paper version at workshops and conferences since september 2012. In december 2015 I decided to start using Github for this. My first Github-project.

# About the document
This document is a LibreOffice "OpenDocument Text" document, so you can download it and immediately use it and print it for a conference  (it is not a "Flat OpenDocument Text", even when that would mean that it's contents can be tracked using git).
